This error occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a URI that points to an image that is not accessible or is invalid. This can happen due to several reasons:

1. **Incorrect URI:** Typos, incorrect paths or missing parameters in the URI can prevent the image from loading.
2. **Network issues:** The device might not have an internet connection or there might be issues connecting to the server hosting the image.
3. **Server-side issues:** The server might be down, or the image might have been removed or renamed.
4. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues:** If the image is hosted on a different domain, CORS restrictions might prevent the Expo app from accessing it.
5. **Image format:** If the image format is not supported by Expo, this can lead to a failure to load. 
6. **Caching Issues:** Sometimes the browser or Expo cache can cause problems. Clearing the cache can help resolve issues.

Here's an example of how the error might manifest itself in the Expo app:
```javascript
<Image source={{ uri: 'https://example.com/image.jpg' }} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />
```
If `https://example.com/image.jpg` is invalid, you may see a blank space where the image should be or a completely broken component.
